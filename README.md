# Dining Philosophers Problem
Ever wondered about the peculiarities of philosophers? Well, here's a twist - these philosophers don't just think; they dine, or at least try to.

## Project Goal:
This project aims to unravel the intricacies of threads and their functionalities through a classic conundrum known as the Dining Philosophers Problem.

## Why this Project?
The Dining Philosophers Problem serves as a quintessential example to understand the challenges of concurrent programming and resource management. By simulating this scenario, we gain insights into thread synchronization, deadlock avoidance, and resource contention resolution.


## Approach:
In order to comprehend the nuances of threading, we delve into the world of POSIX threads (pthread), diving into functions prefixed with 'pthread_' for thread management. POSIX, short for Portable Operating System Interface, ensures compatibility across operating systems, facilitating seamless thread operations.


## Key Concepts:

- **POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface):** Throughout this project, we will interact extensively with POSIX threads (pthread library), leveraging its functions for thread creation, management, and synchronization. POSIX provides a standardized interface for interacting with the underlying operating system, ensuring portability across different platforms.
- **Thread:** At the heart of our exploration lies the concept of a thread - a lightweight process that can execute independently and concurrently with other threads. Threads enable parallelism and multitasking within a single process, allowing for efficient utilization of system resources.
- **Deadlock:** One of the primary challenges in concurrent programming is deadlock - a situation where multiple threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource held by another thread. Deadlocks can arise when threads acquire locks in a non-preemptive manner, leading to a cyclic dependency that halts progress.
- **Data Race (Race Conditions):**  Concurrent access to shared resources can result in race conditions, where the outcome of an operation depends on the timing and interleaving of multiple threads. Data races occur when two or more threads attempt to modify a shared variable concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential program crashes.
- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):** To mitigate race conditions and ensure thread-safe access to shared resources, we will employ mutexes as synchronization primitives. A mutex provides mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread to access a critical section of code at a time. By acquiring and releasing mutex locks, threads can coordinate access to shared resources and prevent data corruption.

 ## Functions to Utilize:

- **pthread_create:** Create a new thread with specified attributes and start routine.
- **pthread_detach:** Detach a thread, allowing it to run independently and release resources upon termination.
- **pthread_join:** Wait for a thread to terminate and retrieve its exit status.
- **pthread_mutex_init:** Initialize a mutex object with specified attributes.
- **pthread_mutex_lock**: Acquire a mutex lock, blocking the calling thread until the lock is available.
- **pthread_mutex_unlock**: Release a mutex lock, allowing other threads to acquire it.
- 'pthread_mutex_destroy': Destroy a mutex object, releasing associated resources.
